He could only solve the problem in which p,q,m,k are positive numbers.
Please help him determine whether the expression could be factorized with p,q,m,k being postive.
 

Input
The first line is a number T, means there are T(1¡ÜT¡Ü100) cases 

Each case has one line,the line has 3 numbers a,b,c(1¡Üa,b,c¡Ü100000000)
