Suddenly, a difficult problem appears 
You are given a sequence of number a1,a2,...,an and a number p. Count the number of the way to choose some of number(choose none of them is also a solution) from the sequence that sum of the numbers is a multiple of p(0 is also count as a multiple of p). Since the answer is very large, you only need to output the answer modulo 109+7

 

Input
The first line contains one integer T(1¡ÜT¡Ü10) - the number of test cases. 
T test cases follow. 
The first line contains two positive integers n,p(1¡Ün,p¡Ü1000) 
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,...an(ai¡Ü109). 
 

Output
For each testcase print a integer, the answer.
 

Sample Input
1
