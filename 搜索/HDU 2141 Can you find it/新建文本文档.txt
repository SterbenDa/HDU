Problem Description
Give you three sequences of numbers A, B, C, then we give you a number X. Now you need to calculate if you can find the three numbers Ai, Bj, Ck, which satisfy the formula Ai+Bj+Ck = X.

 

Input
There are many cases. Every data case is described as followed: In the first line there are three integers L, N, M, in the second line there are L integers represent the sequence A, in the third line there are N integers represent the sequences B, in the forth line there are M integers represent the sequence C. In the fifth line there is an integer S represents there are S integers X to be calculated. 1<=L, N, M<=500, 1<=S<=1000. all the integers are 32-integers.

 

Output
For each case, firstly you have to print the case number as the form "Case d:", then for the S queries, you calculate if the formula can be satisfied or not. If satisfied, you print "YES", otherwise print "NO".
