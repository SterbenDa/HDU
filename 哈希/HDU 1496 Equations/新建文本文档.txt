Problem Description
Consider equations having the following form: 

a*x1^2+b*x2^2+c*x3^2+d*x4^2=0
a, b, c, d are integers from the interval [-50,50] and any of them cannot be 0.

It is consider a solution a system ( x1,x2,x3,x4 ) that verifies the equation, xi is an integer from [-100,100] and xi != 0, any i ∈{1,2,3,4}.

Determine how many solutions satisfy the given equation.

 

Input
