Problem Description
DZY loves playing balls.

He has n balls in a big box. On each ball there is an integer written.

One day he decides to pick two balls from the box. First he randomly picks a ball from the box, and names it A. Next, without putting A back into the box, he randomly picks another ball from the box, and names it B.

If the number written on A is strictly greater than the number on B, he will feel happy.

Now you are given the numbers on each ball. Please calculate the probability that he feels happy.
